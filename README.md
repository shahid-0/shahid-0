# Shahid Khan â€” @shahid-0

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Shahid â€” a junior data scientist at LOOFT âš¡ working on enhancing the energy efficiency of an air conditioning system.

## About me

I worked on various projects and with a variety of technologies. I'm flexibe enought to adapt to any environment, and together with my problem-solver thought, I can be a good fit for any team.

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. In my second year of college (2021), I was already working for a group of companies in the United States, which shows my dedication and interest in becoming a different software engineer.

I consider myself always an apprentice. I aim to teach you whatever I know and I also want to learn from you.
